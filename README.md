During my internship at Bimser, I developed the 'Partner Identification' Application. This application includes an 'Employee management page' that allows the main user to edit and list the employees. It also includes pages where contracts and necessary conditions can be specified between the main user and the user with whom the agreement was made (payment method, payment type, etc.).
